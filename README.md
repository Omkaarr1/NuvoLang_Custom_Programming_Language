# Custom Programming Language Interpreter in Java

This project implements a **custom programming language interpreter** in Java, complete with a **lexer**, **parser**, and **interpreter**. It reads program files, tokenizes and parses them, and executes the code line-by-line. The language supports a wide range of features, including variable assignments, arithmetic operations, conditional statements (`if-else`), functions, arrays, encrypted variables, machine learning integrations, blockchain functionalities, data science operations, **database interactions**, and temporal event triggers.

## Features

### Key Features:

1. **Basic Arithmetic and Variable Assignment**  
   - Supports integer and floating-point arithmetic.  
   - Assignment using `=` and compound assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`).  
   - Increment and decrement operators (`++`, `--`) in both prefix and postfix forms.

2. **Data Types**  
   - Integers and floating-point numbers.  
   - Strings delimited by double quotes `" "`.  
   - Booleans (`true`, `false`).  
   - Arrays created using bracket syntax `[element1, element2, ...]`.

3. **Variables**  
   - Dynamically assigned and typed variables.  
   - **Encrypted Variables**: Variables prefixed with `@ENC`. Their values are stored encrypted, internally decrypted when needed for operations, then re-encrypted.

4. **Operators and Comparisons**  
   - Standard arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`.  
   - Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.  
   - Logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`.

5. **Control Flow**  
   - `if`/`else` statements for conditional execution.  
   - `while` loops for iteration based on a boolean condition.  
   - `for` loops supporting initialization, condition, and increment expressions.

6. **Functions**  
   - User-defined functions declared with the `function` keyword.  
   - Parameterized functions with return values using `return`.  
   - Recursive functions are supported.  
   - Functions stored in a symbol table, callable by name.

7. **Input/Output**  
   - `print->"message";` for printing to standard output.  
   - `input->"prompt"-> variable;` for reading user input into a variable.  
   - Supports string concatenation and printing of variables/expressions.

8. **Arrays**  
   - Creation of arrays, e.g. `arr = [1, 2, 3];`  
   - Concatenation with `+=`.  
   - Arrays can contain mixed types (numbers, strings, booleans).

9. **Encryption Support**  
   - **Encrypted Variables**: Variables starting with `@ENC` store their values in encrypted form.  
   - Internally handles encryption/decryption during operations.  
   - Example usage: `@ENCsecret = "mySecretValue";`.

10. **Temporal Programming (Event Triggers)**  
    - **Unique Feature**: Scheduling of code execution at specific times or intervals.  
    - Syntax Examples:
      - `@EVENT_TRIGGER(duration,"seconds") -> <statement>;`  
      - `@EVENT_TRIGGER("YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS") -> <statement>;`  
    - **Use Cases**: Event-driven, time-based script execution.

11. **Machine Learning Integration**  
    - **ML Library**: Integrates with Weka for ML tasks.  
    - **Methods**: `randomforest(csvPath, targetColumn)`, `linearregression(csvPath, targetColumn)`, `kmeans(csvPath)`.  
    - **Features**: Loads CSV, trains/evaluates models, prints metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

12. **Blockchain Functionality**  
    - **Blockchain Library**: Simulates basic blockchain operations.  
    - **Methods**: `init(privateKey, initialAmount)`, `transaction(toAddress, amount)`, `showCurrentBalance()`, `showTransactionHistory()`.

13. **Data Science Operations**  
    - **DataScience Library**: Provides data manipulation/statistical analysis.  
    - **Methods**: `loadCSV`, `calculateMean`, `calculateMedian`, `calculateStdDev`, `plotHistogram`, `plotScatter`, `filterData`.

14. **Database Operations**  
    - **Database Library**: Allows interaction with SQL databases via JDBC.  
    - **Methods**: `connect`, `query`, `close`.  
    - Supports MySQL/PostgreSQL.

15. **AI Integration: SONAR AI**  
    - **SONAR AI** is an intelligent assistant for this language. It is powered by a **custom-trained machine learning model** specifically designed to understand the syntax and semantics of the custom language.

    ### How It Works:
    - A machine learning model is trained using thousands of code examples, patterns, and syntax rules from the language.
    - It is deployed as a **cloud-based API** (e.g., AWS SageMaker, EC2) which is accessible via HTTP requests.
    - The frontend (IDE or Interpreter UI) sends **natural language prompts** to this API.
    - The response is a valid code snippet, fix, or explanation generated by the AI.

    ### Example Flow:
    ```plaintext
    User: "Write a loop that prints 'Hello' every 2 seconds."
    SONAR AI:
    @EVENT_TRIGGER(2, "seconds") -> print->"Hello";
    ```

    ### Benefits:
    - Natural language to code.
    - Debugging and syntax correction.
    - Code explanation and best practices.
    - Accelerated prototyping.

    ### Tech Stack:
    - ML Model: PyTorch/TensorFlow or fine-tuned LLM.
    - API: Flask/FastAPI + Docker.
    - Deployment: AWS EC2/SageMaker.
    - Frontend: JavaFX or React calling the API.

    ### Sample API:
    ```json
    POST /api/sonar/generateCode
    {
      "query": "Create a function to calculate factorial."
    }
    ```
